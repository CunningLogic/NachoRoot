NachoRoot is a root exploit for the ASUS Transformer Prime released on 01/03/2012. It was held closed source until 01/05/2012. I had intented to wait until ICS was shipped to release source, but on 01/04/2012 someone posted source (almost) working source for the exploit on XDA, and on the 5th it was added to Google's CTS tests.
